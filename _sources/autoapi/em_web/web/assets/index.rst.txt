.. py:module:: em_web.web.assets

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Web assets.

   Each route in EM Web has its own css and js bundle in an effort
   to keep bundle size as small as possible.

   Specific css and js that is not always required can be kept in their
   own bundles and imported as needed.
