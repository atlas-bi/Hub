Projects
********

.. note:: A project is a group of tasks that should be run on the same schedule.

Projects include three primary pages:

- All Projects. This loads a paginated table of all projects along with a name cloud of project owners.
- My Projects. This loads a paginated table of all projects for the specified owner.
- Project Details. Summary page of some project events and a few actions that can be taken.
- New Project. The page to create or edit a project. If no projects, or no tasks exists, users are directed here to create a project.

Project Details
###############

There are two actions a user can take in a project - delete or edit. Editing options are explained in the `New Project`_ section.

There are a few task control options:

- Add a task. This will redirect to the :ref:`task_new` page, tasks can only be created under a project.
- Disable all tasks. This will prevent any new runs for tasks in the project.
- Enable all tasks. This will allow the project schedule to run all the tasks.
- Run all tasks. This will immediately run all tasks.

New Project
###########

When creating or editing a project the same steps can be used. By default a new project is owned by the creator. However, users have the option of taking ownership of existing projects by checking the "Take Ownership of Project" button.


Triggers
========

There are three types of triggers for a project.

Cron
----

The cron schedule follows the typical linux type scheduling. More information can be found `here <https://crontab.guru>`_ and some `examples <https://crontab.guru/examples.html>`_.

Check the "Use a cron schedule" box to enable a cron schedule.

Fill in parameters as required. Leave fields blank as a wildcard.

Interval
--------

Check the "Use an interval schedule" box to enable an interval schedule.

An interval schedule will run a project "ever x <time period>". Where the time periods is either

- week(s)
- day(s)
- hour(s)
- minute(s)
- second(s)

One Off
-------

It is also possible to schedule an additional one-time schedule.

.. _project_parameters:

Parameters
==========

Parameters can be used to modify sql queries at run time. Parameters must be in one of two formats:

.. code:: python

    <param_name> = <param_value>

    # or

    <param_name> : <param_value>

For example:

.. code:: sql

    -- parameter
    myDate = getdate()

    -- original SQL
    Declare @myDate = tomorrow

    -- final SQL
    Declare @myDate = getdate()


.. note:: The code preview in :ref:`task_details` is modified to include parameter values. Verify this is correct when adding parameters!

.. note:: Project parameters will be passed to all tasks in the project, but can be overridden at the task level.
